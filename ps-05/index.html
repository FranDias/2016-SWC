      <h3>Create a web page which illustrates and describes an optical illusion.
        This could be an HTML document with an image tag that explains a real
        cognitive effect, or it could be a scam, where you trick us using canvas
        and animation.</h3>

        examination charts are small posters with rows of type arranged from large to
