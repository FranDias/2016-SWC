      <h3>Josef Müller-Brockmann (May 9, 1914 – August 30, 1996) was a Swiss graphic designer and educator.<p>

        He is considered to be a key player in the Swiss School of international Style. He was influenced by the ideas of several different design and art movements
        including Constructivism, De Stijl, Suprematism, and the Bauhaus.<p>

        Perhaps his most recognized work was done for the Zurich Town Hall. The work is graphic, rather than illustrative. Some critics say these posters
        created a mathematical harmony, which reflected the harmony of music. <p>
