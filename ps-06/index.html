      <h3>Surrealist artists and poets participated in parlor games randomly placing jarring
        images and text together to tap the creativity of the unconscious mind. In the drawing
        version of this game, each artist would draw either the head, body, and feet of a
        exotic creature.</h3>

      <h3>The literary version of this assignment involves creating multiple lines of poetry.
        Each poet writes one line, and then folds the paper over so that the next author can
        not see what has been written. Create a web page which generates such verse. </h3>
